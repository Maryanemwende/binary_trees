### 0x1D. C - Binary trees
A binary tree is a data structure used in computer science and mathematics to organize and store data efficiently. It consists of nodes connected in a hierarchical structure, where each node has at most two children: a left child and a right child. 
The topmost node in a binary tree is called the root, and nodes with no children are known as leaf nodes. The nodes in a binary tree are typically used to store some form of data, such as numbers, text, or objects.
